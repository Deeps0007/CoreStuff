I discover a new technique to find the occurence of char in the given String.
Firstly remove all the blank spaces with nothing. And after this ,find the length of the string.
Then replace the charAt(0) position with nothing.Now again find the length of the string. This wiil give you the occurence of a char .
Repeate this concept untill the length of the string become zero.
